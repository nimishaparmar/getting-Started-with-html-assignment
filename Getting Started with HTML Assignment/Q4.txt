HTML Tag:- 
HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your
web page. Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag. For example, <opening tag> 
is the opening tag and </closing tag> is the closing tag.
There are four required tags in HTML.These are html, title, head and body.

HTML Element :-
An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a
closing tag. For example, <p> is starting tag of a paragraph and </p> is closing tag of the same 
paragraph but < p>This is paragraph</p> is a paragraph element.
There are three kinds of HTML elements: normal elements, raw text elements, and void elements. 
Normal elements usually have both a start tag and an end tag, although for some elements the end tag,
or both tags, can be omitted.
